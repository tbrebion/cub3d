## Ray Casting
This 42 common core's project is a way to discover ray casting. 
>Ray casting is the methodological basis for 3D CAD/CAM solid modeling and image rendering. It is essentially the same as ray tracing for computer graphics >where virtual light rays are "cast" or "traced" on their path from the focal point of a camera through each pixel in the camera sensor to determine what >is visible along the ray in the 3D scene.
